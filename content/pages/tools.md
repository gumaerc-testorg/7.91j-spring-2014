Sequence alignments provide a powerful way to compare novel sequences with previously characterized genes. Both functional and evolutionary information can be inferred from well designed queries and alignments. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) provides a method for rapid searching of nucleotide and protein databases. It is a sequence comparison algorithm optimized for speed used to search sequence databases for optimal local alignments to a query.

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}
Nearly all proteins have structural similarities with other proteins and, in some of these cases, share a common evolutionary origin. The Structural Classification Of Proteins (SCOP) database, created by manual inspection and abetted by a battery of automated methods, aims to provide a detailed and comprehensive description of the structural and evolutionary relationships between all proteins whose structure is known. As such, it provides a broad survey of all known protein folds, detailed information about the close relatives of any particular protein, and a framework for future research and classification.
